Hello, welcome to my personal website. My name is Till Münster.

I am a research assistant currently pursuing his Ph.D. in accounting at the University of Münster, Germany. Before this, I studied business administration and economics at universities and business schools in Bielefeld (Germany), Münster (Germany), and Oslo (Norway). You can find out more about me in my CV, which will be available shortly.
